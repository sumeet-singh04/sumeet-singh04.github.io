                Hi, I am Sumeet.
                <br>
                Passionate about learning new technologies, I always strive to find elegant solutions to complex problems.
                IN love with AngularJS and UI designing, it can't seem to think of anything else.
                <br>
                Here, I started a repository so that I could contribute to ever flowing community of web developers.
                Well I believe every bit of code counts and makes
                web a unique resource to share knowledge, experience and life.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have 1+ years of experience in working with AngularJS, Java, CSS/HTML, CSS preprocessors like SASS.
                Currently working with a service provider, providing consultation to a US based Wealth management Giant, I have helped move the clients Web App
                from Flex to AngularJS.
